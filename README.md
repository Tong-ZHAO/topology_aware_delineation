# Topology Aware Delineation

Final Project for M2 MVA course: Deformable models and geodesic methods for image analysis. In this project, we implement and analyse the method proposed in [Beyond the Pixel-Wise Loss for Topology-Aware Delineation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Mosinska_Beyond_the_Pixel-Wise_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).
